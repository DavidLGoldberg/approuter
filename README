This thing is designed to manage multiple versions of an application 
running simultaneously.  It will manage two types of running applications:
production and alternate.  

production - the 'in production' version of the application, this version
    will be managed as if it's presence were important and upgrades 
    to the underlying code (changes detected in the repo) will cause
    a graceful switch where the users should notice no downtime.

alternate - new 'in test' versions of the application.  Changes from the source
    repo for these applications are immediately applied with the existing version
    being forcibly replaced with the new.  The assumption here is that this 
    version is being worked on and you want your changes to be immediately
    available.

Other definitions

instance - a named instance of an application for example, the the case
    of having multiple alternate instances one might have alternate instances
    a, b, and c.  Production type applications only have two instances
    active and inactive.  

Routing amongst the application instances is managed by cookie, with the 
presence of the a type/instance cookie causing the request to be routed
to the correct type/instance.
